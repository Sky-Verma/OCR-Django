I have created this app just for practise. If you want to use it then you have to download Tesseract -OCR engine to make it work from the link given below and give the location of tesseract.exe file to tess.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd inside views.py file.</br>
You also need pytesseract and Pillow packages of Python </br>
It's easy to use! </br>

Use python -m pip install pytesseract  for installing Pytesseract for using Tesserect OCR engine </br>
Use python -m pip install pytesseract  for installing Pytesseract for using Tesserect OCR engine </br>
Use python -m pip install pillow for processing Image
